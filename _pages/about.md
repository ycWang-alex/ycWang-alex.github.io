Research
------
Critical Node Identification of Cascading Failure Based on Structural Controllability（2022/04-present） [manuscript](../assets/manuscript.pdf)

Team member   

. Responsible for deriving models, building simulation models, and writing papers

. We use critical edge theory to evaluate the importance of nodes by considering critical edges, redundant edges and common edges as well as the tendency of nodes to near collapse. It makes the local neighborhood information of nodes effective for large-scale networks 

. The algorithm effectively transformed the controllability of network edge structure in cybernetics and the cascading impact of links in cascading failure at the theoretical level. And link criticality is used as a feature at the structural level. Combined with the attribute feature of node collapse value, the invulnerability performance of cascaded network is described.

. The empirical analysis of real power grids shows that the performance of the method in this paper is better than that of the degree centrality algorithm, current betweenness centrality algorithm, WL algorithm and CI algorithm in the cascading failure process of power grids of all sizes.

. The paper has been almost done and will be published on SCI Zone 3, and I will be the first author
