University of Electronic Science and Technology of China （2019/08-2023/07）

. GPA: 3.54/4.0

. Major: Electronic Information Engineering

. Main courses: Frontiers in Wireless Artificial Intelligence, Digital Signal Processing, Digital Radio  System Design, Signal Processing and Music Applications, Experiment of Electronic Circuit, High-level Language Programming, Digital Logic Circuit and System


Research
------
Critical Node Identification of Cascading Failure Based on Structural Controllability（2022/04-present）

Team member   

. Responsible for deriving models, building simulation models, and writing papers

. Repeatedly tried modeling methods, and found better solutions by further studying knowledge of cybernetics

. After  finding  a  model  that  could be  explained  in  principle,  I  wrote  code  to build  a  simulation  scenario, simulated cascading failures in a real electrical network, and then searched convincing parameters to compare the feasibility of my method

. The paper has been almost done and will be published on SCI Zone 3, and I will be the first author
